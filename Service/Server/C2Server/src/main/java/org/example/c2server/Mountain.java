/**
 * Class that represents a mountain - mountains have an integer ID, a name, an altitude (height), a range (mountain
 * range), and a country; they are also either in the Northern hemisphere or not.
 * Mountains need to be represented on both the service and the client - and you may or may not want to use the code
 * below as the basis for the version on the service. But you probably should use this code for the client.
 * Note that the integer ID should be uniquely generated on the service when a mountain is created - how you do this
 * is up to you provided it's unique and an integer. It's fine if the ID changes when you update a mountain.
 * This version of Mountain just generates a dummy ID of 0 because it's intended for you to use in your client code - as
 * a simplification, there is no need to worry about this: it's simpler if the Mountain objects that are created on the
 * client to upload to the server (either as new or replacement data) than to deal wih the fact that the ones you upload
 * are different to the ones you download because the uploaded ones don't need an ID.
 * NOTE: You will HAVE to change this code for the server to automatically generate unique IDs and you may choose to
 * change it (or add to it) in other ways too.
